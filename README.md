# Swift for TensorFlow

Welcome to the Swift for TensorFlow development community!

Swift for TensorFlow is the result of first-principles thinking applied to machine learning frameworks and aims to take TensorFlow usability to new heights. Swift for TensorFlow is based on the belief that machine learning is important enough for first-class language and compiler support, and thus works very differently from normal language bindings.

First-class language and compiler support allow us to innovate in areas that
traditionally were out of bounds for machine learning libraries. Our programming model combines the performance of TensorFlow graphs with the flexibility and expressivity of Eager execution, while keeping a strong focus on improved usability at every level of the stack.

**Note:** Swift for TensorFlow is an early stage research project. It has been released to enable open source development and is not yet ready for general use by machine learning developers.

## Installation and Usage

You can download a pre-built package for Swift for TensorFlow [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). After installing Swift for TensorFlow, you can learn how to use the project [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Usage.md).

For instructions on building from source, visit [google/swift](https://github.com/google/swift/tree/tensorflow).

## Documentation

Below are some documents explaining the Swift for TensorFlow project.

Conceptual:

- [Swift for TensorFlow Design Overview](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/DesignOverview.md)
- [Why *Swift* for TensorFlow?](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/WhySwiftForTensorFlow.md)

- [Automatic Differentiation](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/AutomaticDifferentiation.md)
- [Python Interoperability](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/PythonInteroperability.md)

## Source code

Currently, the active development of Swift for TensorFlow will happen under the "tensorflow" branch of
[google/swift](https://github.com/google/swift/tree/tensorflow).

These projects include:

- The compiler and standard libraries: [google/swift](http://github.com/google/swift/tree/tensorflow)
- Debugger and REPL support: [google/swift-lldb](http://github.com/google/swift-lldb)

As the code matures, we aim to move it upstream to the corresponding [Swift.org](https://swift.org) repositories.

## Models

You can find example models in
[tensorflow/swift-models](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models).

## Bugs

Please stay tuned on how to file bugs and feature requests.

## Community

Discussion about Swift for TensorFlow happens on the
