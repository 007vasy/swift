We are using [JIRA](https://bugs.swift.org) instead of Github issues to track
our work in order to integrate more effectively with the rest of the Swift
ecosystem.

Before opening a new issue, please [search the existing
issues](https://bugs.swift.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20TF) to see if your
issue has already been asked. If it's open, you can _Add Vote_ to request
the issue be prioritized. And you can start watching the issue to receive
updates.

If there are no related issues in JIRA, please file a new ticket by using one
of the links below corresponding to the nature of your issue:
